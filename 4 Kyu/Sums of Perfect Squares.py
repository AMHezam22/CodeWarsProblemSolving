# Problem Instruction:
#   The task is simply stated. Given an integer n (3 < n < 109),
#   find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares which add up to n.
#   Come up with the best algorithm you can; you'll need it!

# Problem Solution:
#   You can write an algorithm that solves the problem,
#   but it won't be completely accurate only if you followed a mathematical formula.
#   Which is Lagrangeâ€™s Four Square Theorem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_three-square_theorem
#   however, I wrote down my algorithm and then the solution by the Theorem.


# in my algorithm solution I used -Before I raed about it ^_____^- :
#  - Overlapping Sub-problem- Dynamic Programming:
# 		 Which  solves a given complex problem by breaking it into sub-problems. "recursion function"
#  - Memoization (Top Down):
# 		 Which looks into a lookup table before computing solutions.

d = {0: 0, 4: 2, 3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1}
